Array Query problems

1.Kaden's Algorithm:- 
    used to perform subarray operations i.e subarray sum,min/max number 
    efficency=O(n)

2.Segement Tree:- 
    Given 'n' nodes 
    tree creation = O(n)
    height of Tree = log(n)
    Query and update the tree = log(n)

3.Lookup Table:-
    The table size depends on the nature of the problem but query time is O(1) i.e constant time.

4.Sparse Tree:-
    used for faster queries
    space complexity = nlog(n)
    Quer acess time = O(n)
    time to build table = nlog(n)

5.Square root decomposition and MO's Algorithm:-
    Space efficency = Squareroot(n)
    processing time = Squareroot(n)
    *can't handle dynamic queries

6.Fenwick Tree:-
    Space complexity = n
    Query time = log(n)

Note :- Merge sort tree,
